# History of Video Games in the Last 40 Years

## Goal
In this project, I collaborated with [Gabriele Ghiotto](https://github.com/gabrieleghiotto) to analyze a video game dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) to answer some questions about the history of the video game industry like:
* What is the most successful video game in history?
* What is the most successful publisher?
* What is the most successful game franchise?
* What is the historical development of publishers, game platforms, and genres?

## Data
The dataset used in the project is an excerpt from a dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/rush4ratio/video-game-sales-with-ratings) which contains the data about video games from 1980 to 2016 such as a game's publisher, genre, platform, and sales (global and by market).
Game franchises were scraped from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_franchises) using the script available in this repository.

## Installation
You can install all the necessary libraries to run the project by running:

```
conda create --name <env_name> --file requirements.txt
```

if using ```conda```.
